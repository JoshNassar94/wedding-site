			  <p>In the fall of 2013, two wide-eyed freshmen at the University of Florida started going to the BCM. Although they were around each other all the time at the BCM and  
			  at River Cross Church, they never really got to know each other. They simply saw each other around at events and hung out with their respective friends, not knowing 
			  that their futures would be so intertwined.</p>

			  their struggles, the things that really made them tick. It was a year filled with plenty of fun times, during which the hashtag #fishwifeforlife was born.</p>

			  <p>After spending an entire summer apart, Hanna in Portland and Josh in Orlando, the two were reunited at the BCM Leadership Retreat in August. This was a time where 
			  the BCM leadership team would plan the events for the entire next year; Hanna was the new President, and Josh was one of the Freshman Team leaders. While catching up after a summer 
			  on different sides of the country, Josh began to develop feelings for Hanna. These feelings grew even stronger after talking out on the beach into the early hours of the morning.</p>

			  tacos, took Hanna out to La Tienda, a Mexican restaurant local to Gainesville. After a delicious meal, they continued home to a dessert of chocolate covered strawberries and enjoyed 
			  a movie together. After Josh took Hanna home, he knew that he had found someone truly special, the thought of which made him one of the happiest fellas on the planet that night.</p>

			  <p>After many more dates (and even more nights spent inside studying together), Josh and Hanna began to fall in love. They worked at desks right next to each other, 
			  helped lead worship at church on Sunday mornings, and helped on the executive team at the BCM. When Josh broke his foot in November, Hanna did all she could to take 
			  care of him, showing him the true love that she had for him. As they began to talk more and more about the possibility of marriage, Josh began to devise a plan...</p>

			<div class="timeline-body">
			  <p>On Leap Day 2016, that plan was put into action. Josh had been giving Hanna clues to their "Great Date" in the form of websites (like this one) for weeks, trying to make 
			  her think there was no way he would propose on a day he had told her so much about. After a meal at a Mexican restaurant and a walk through the park, they decided to take a 
			  stroll along the bay on the way to a fancy dinner. During the walk, they came across something written on the ground that Josh pretended to know nothing about, although he 
			  himself had written it earlier that day.</p>
			  <p>"Take a Leap" it said, in large letters. Hanna took the first jump and Josh marked it on the ground. As Josh got ready to jump, Hanna reminded him that he couldn't, as he 
			  was still recovering from a broken foot. "You're right," Josh responded. "So I'll take a leap of a different kind." With that, Josh got down on one knee and asked Hanna to be 
			  his wife. Ten months and one day later, that will finally become a reality!</p>
